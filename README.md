**Accurate Marine Object Detection Based on Multistage Deep Learning Framework**

Underwater environments present unique challenges for object detection which includes degraded image quality,  poor visibility, low contrast, and color distortion. 
Addressing these challenges requires the development of specialized algorithms, techniques, and datasets that can handle the unique characteristics of underwater environments.
The system should be able to handle real-time or near real-time processing of underwater imagery and provide accurate and reliable object detection results.

So, Our overall objective is to develop an enhanced model for image enhancement and a model for object detection. Combining these two, we are proving that object detection 
performs best for enhanced images. 

Here, We have introduced the **MarineDetNet** which performs image enhancement and object detection sequentially, ie., after performing image enhancement, the enhanced images 
are given as an input for a object detection model for training.
