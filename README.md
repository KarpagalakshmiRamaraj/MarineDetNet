**Accurate Marine Object Detection Based on Multistage Deep Learning Framework**

Underwater environments present unique challenges for object detection which includes degraded image quality,  poor visibility, low contrast, and color distortion. 
Addressing these challenges requires the development of specialized algorithms, techniques, and datasets that can handle the unique characteristics of underwater environments.
The system should be able to handle real-time or near real-time processing of underwater imagery and provide accurate and reliable object detection results.

So, Our overall objective is to develop an enhanced model for image enhancement and a model for object detection. Combining these two, we are proving that object detection 
performs best for enhanced images. 

Here, We have introduced the **MarineDetNet** which performs image enhancement and object detection sequentially, ie., after performing image enhancement, the enhanced images 
are given as an input for a object detection model for training. 

**Image enhancement**

Underwater image enhancement is aims to improve the visibility and quality of images captured underwater. The image enhancement subnetwork is preceded by three convolution layers with kernels of  3x3, 5x5, 3x3. The channels of convolution layers is 32. The image enhancement subnet has series of convolution layers. It contains three 3x3 convolution layers followed by a batch normalization and ReLu activation function. The fourth convolution layer with kernel size 3x3 is followed by  batch normalization and sigmoid activation function. The sigmoid function squashes the input to an output between 0 and 1. The output channel size of the image enhancement subnet is 3. From the enhanced feature map, the enhanced image can be obtained. 

**Object detection**

The main parts of object detection is RFB and CSP-ResNet 

**Receptive Field Block(RFB)**

The Receptive Field Block (RFB) is used to enhance the ability of a neural network to capture and understand complex spatial relationships within an image. By using the RFB, the network can effectively analyze and process large regions of the input image, allowing it to extract more detailed and contextually rich features. The RFB has 3 paths. The first path has convolution layer with kernel size 1x1 followed 3x3 convolution at dilation rate 1. The second path has convolution layers with kernel  size 1x1, 3x3 followed by 3x3 convolution at dilation rate 3. The third path has convolution layers with kernel size 1x1, 5x5 followed by 3x3 convolution at dilation rate 5. 
The result from three paths are concatenated and 1x1 convolution is applied.

**Cross Stage Partial Residual Network(CSP-ResNet)**

In CSPNet, feature maps are split into two parts and one part is processed to subsequent stages without modification.
CSPNet is incorporated into the ResNet. The backbone of CSPResNet is formed by a series of residual blocks. Each residual block consists of two or more convolutional layers.
Within each residual block, there is a feature aggregation step that combines the processed and unprocessed feature maps. This step ensures that the information from both parts is effectively integrated, allowing for enhanced feature reuse and learning
